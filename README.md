# rtaXX (rta++)
Real-Time tasks with C++ template metaprogramming

This is an experiment to check how difficult is to
create real-time tasks in C++, automagially checking
for their schedulability at compile time (through
C++ Template Meta Programming -- TMP).

The schedulability is analysed by using Response
Time Analysis (RTA), see rta.hh (and rta_check
in particular).
